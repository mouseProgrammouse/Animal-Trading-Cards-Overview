      <p>Pembrokes feature pointed ears. They are low-set, intelligent, strong and sturdy with stamina sufficient to work a day on the farm. The common height at the withers is between 25–30 cm, while a male dog of this breed should weigh more than 14 kg, and
        a female 11 kg. Historically, the Pembroke was a breed with a natural bob tail (a very short tail), and today, if the Pembroke has a tail at all, it is usually curly. </p>
